# Priority Queue
This Abstract Data Structure is like any stack or queue. But the main
difference it is expecting a Comparator in Java. With this will know
what will be the next element for polling the data. This data structure
is good for merge different List and others. and it works for this 
good data strucutres :

1. [MinHeap](MinHeap.md)
2. MaxHeap

In Java for Creating a Priority Queue is very easy.
`PriorityQueue<Integer> myPriorityQueue=new PriorityQueue<>();`
As Integer can be comparable this will be take the minimun integer
for each poll of Data.
