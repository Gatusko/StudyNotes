# Strings 
Strings it is a chain of Characters and in a better way to understand this 
is an Array of Characters that can form a word or another thing.
**In Java Strings are Inmmutable Objects** So every time we create
a String we can't mutate that String It will be creating a new one
that is why it can be very expensive the time of using subString or 
summing more things like integers, characters or another string. Java
will create a new String. So adding a new value to our String will
be O(n) Time. 

# Techinques of Strings
